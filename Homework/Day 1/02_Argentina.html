           <h3><li>Argentina Group Stage</li></h3>
            <p>The reigning Copa America champions were disappointed in Brazil back in 2014. However, they finally realised their dream of world domination in 2022.Argentina had won the World Cup twice in their history in 1978 & 1986.Argentina finished top of the group with six points. Poland came in two points behind them in second place.
                Lionel Scaloni’s men started their campaign on a disappointing note as they lost 2-1 to Saudi Arabia, but came strongly with two consecutive 2-0 victories against Mexico and Poland.
<br><br>
                Summarily, Argentina’s opening World Cup match against Saudi Arabia in Lusail saw Group C’s top seeds meet its underdogs.
                Scaloni’s men were expected to get off to a winning start before their eye-catching clash with Mexico four days later, but things fell apart.
                Having gone ahead via a Messi penalty, a double from Saudi Arabia duo Saleh Al-Sherhi and Salem Al-Dawsari stunned them, and left their initial hopes in tatters.
<br><br>
                However, they were back on track against Mexico on November 26. Messi and Enzo Fernandez scored two stunning goals to give the Albiceleste a 2-0 win that breathed life back into their chances of advancing to the Round of 16.
<br><br>
                Next up was Poland, ranked 26th in the FIFA world rankings, who threatened to upset Argentina’s campaign in the group decider on November 30. But second-half goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez saw them through as group winners.
            </p>
